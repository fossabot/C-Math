/*
 * In algebra, a cubic function is a function of the form:
 * f ( x ) = a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d
 * in which a is nonzero.
 *
 * Setting f(x) = 0 produces a cubic equation of the form "a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d = 0".
 * The solutions of this equation are called roots of the polynomial f(x). If all of the coefficients a, b, c,
 * and d of the cubic equation are real numbers, then it has at least one real root (this is true for all
 * odd degree polynomials). All of the roots of the cubic equation can be found algebraically. (This is also
 * true of quadratic (second degree) or quartic (fourth degree) equations, but not of higher-degree equations,
 * by the Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem.) The roots can also be found trigonometrically. Alternatively,
 * numerical approximations of the roots can be found using root-finding algorithms such as Newton's method.
 *
 * The coefficients do not need to be complex numbers. Much of what is covered below is valid for coefficients
 * of any field with characteristic 0 or greater than 3. The solutions of the cubic equation do not necessarily
 * belong to the same field as the coefficients. For example, some cubic equations with rational coefficients have
 * roots that are non-rational (and even non-real) complex numbers.
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * asl_cubic_real_root finds REAL roots of a cubic function F(X) = a x^3 + b x^2 + cx + d.
 *
 * DISCUSSION:
 * nothing.

 * d            x^0 coefficient
 * verbose      show process {0: no, 1: yes}
 * state        is answer found or not, it will indicate how many roots have been found
 *
 * RETURN:
 * pointer to an array of three elements, containing roots
 * this return must be handled with the value of "state"
