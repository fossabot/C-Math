     * In algebra, a cubic function is a function of the form:
     * f ( x ) = a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d
     * in which a is nonzero.
     *
     * Setting f(x) = 0 produces a cubic equation of the form "a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d = 0".
     * The solutions of this equation are called roots of the polynomial f(x). If all of the coefficients a, b, c,
     * and d of the cubic equation are real numbers, then it has at least one real root (this is true for all
     * odd degree polynomials). All of the roots of the cubic equation can be found algebraically. (This is also
     * true of quadratic (second degree) or quartic (fourth degree) equations, but not of higher-degree equations,
     * by the Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem.) The roots can also be found trigonometrically. Alternatively,
     * numerical approximations of the roots can be found using root-finding algorithms such as Newton's method.
     *
     * The coefficients do not need to be complex numbers. Much of what is covered below is valid for coefficients
     * of any field with characteristic 0 or greater than 3. The solutions of the cubic equation do not necessarily
     * belong to the same field as the coefficients. For example, some cubic equations with rational coefficients have
     * roots that are non-rational (and even non-real) complex numbers.
     *
     * PURPOSE:
     * asl_cubic_real_root finds REAL roots of a cubic function F(X) = a x^3 + b x^2 + cx + d.
     *
     * DISCUSSION:
     * nothing.
