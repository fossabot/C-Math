/*
     * The Bisection method in mathematics is a root-finding method that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects
     * a sub-interval in which a root must lie for further processing. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is
     * also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is
     * then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods. The method is also called the interval
     * halving method, the binary search method, or the dichotomy method.
     *
     * PURPOSE:
     * ASL_bisection_root seeks a root of a function F(X) in an interval [A, B].
     *
     * DISCUSSION:
     * This function assumes that F(A)*F(B) < 0.
