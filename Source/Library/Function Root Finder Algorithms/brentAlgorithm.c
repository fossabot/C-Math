     * In numerical analysis, Brent's method is a root-finding algorithm combining the bisection method,
     * the secant method and inverse quadratic interpolation. It has the reliability of bisection but it can be
     * as quick as some of the less-reliable methods. The algorithm tries to use the potentially fast-converging
     * secant method or inverse quadratic interpolation if possible, but it falls back to the more robust
     * bisection method if necessary. Brent's method is due to Richard Brent and builds on an earlier algorithm
     * by Theodorus Dekker. Consequently, the method is also known as the Brentâ€“Dekker method. 
     *
     * PURPOSE:
     * asl_brent_root seeks a root of a function F(X) in an interval [A, B].
     *
     * DISCUSSION:
     * This function assumes that F(A)*F(B) < 0.
